- Elements of Python:
	+ Vocalburary/Words: variables and reserved words (chap 2)
	+ sentence struture: valid syntax patterns (chap 3-5)
	+ story stucture: constructing a program for a purpose

- Reserved Words:
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise

- Sentences/Lines:
x = 2		<--- assignment statement
x = x + 2	<--- assignment with expression
print(x)	<--- print statement

x:		variable
"=", "+":	operator
2:		constant
print:		reserved word

- Sequential Steps: when program is running, it folows one step to the next step. Programmers set up "path" for the program to follow
x = 2
print(x)
x = x + 2
print(x)

- Conditional Steps: syntax tend to be used is "if"
x = 5
if x < 10
   print('smaller')
if x > 20
   print('bigger')
print('finis')

---> OUTPUT: smaller
	     finis

- Repeated Steps (Loops): have iteration variables that change each time throuh a loop (syntax: for, while)
n = 5 
while n > 0:
   print(n)
   n = n - 1
print('Blastoff')

---> OUTPUT: 	5
		4
		3
		2
		1
		Blastoff
